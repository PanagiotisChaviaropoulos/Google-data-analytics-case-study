# Google-data-analytics-case-study
## Summary
In this project I am working for a fictional company named Cyclistic along with some other key team members, and I will be performing several junior data analyst real life tasks to adress the business problem.
In order to answer the business questions, I will utilize the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.
## Company information
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing (Moreno) has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.

## Scenario
Let's assume I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Ask
The director of marketing, Moreno has assigned me to answer the question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
### Business task
Determine how to maximize annual memberships by converting casual riders to members.
